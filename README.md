# Grasshopper 4 The Web 2024


This course teaches you how to use grasshopper to build configurators, influenced by an external dataset. After finishing the exercices you will be able to use Grasshopper to:

- Query API and grab external data
- Read data files and 
- Create cluster components capable of generating


## Using API Data



## Using Local Data

You can import datasets in various formats using Grasshopper vanilla and third party plugins. For each file type you can use one of the following:

### CSV Documents

[Comma-separated values documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) is a common document format that you might find when using exports from many consumer, business, and scientific applications.







#### Pedestrian Simulation

- [Flow](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/flow) - Pedestrian simulation library similar to PedsimPro 


#### 3D Model Exporters

- [Triceraptops](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/triceratops) - Allows you to export Mesh object and to create 3D scenes usable in TreeJS




# Project Brief

You are part of **Eco Panels*, an innovative startup that produces custom wooden panels that encapsulate older buildings, increasing shading and reducing their cooling consumption with minimum costs.

We've been in touch with our client from Greece, Athens who is interested in integrating the facade panels in his office building. We already ran through a few options with him, but it's been difficult to agree the right panel arrangement with him. We informed him that our analysis tools will automatically produce the most efficent cooling result, but he also desires to keep some rooms with less view obstructions for a variety of reasons. It is very difficult for him to describe the desired result and were are stuck with multiple other projects at the moment.

The clinet owns multiple office buildings arround souther Europe and additional work will come afther this one. I am sure they will require the same process, since they share common architectural caractheristics.

We need to produce a MVP configurator for our panels, that would allow the client to produce his own configuration of our facade on his building.
