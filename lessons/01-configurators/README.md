# Grasshopper configurators
In this chapter we will define configurators and the utility of Grasshopper in producing configurators in AEC.


## Industry problems 
A tool or software application that allows users to customize and configure products or services according to their specific needs or preferences. 

In the AEC industry the configurators are designed for the complexities of building design and construction projects. It allows architects, engineers, and clients to customize various aspects of a project, such as:

- **Building Design:** Users can select architectural styles, materials, layouts, and dimensions for buildings, helping to visualize and refine design options

- **Components and Systems:** choosing structural elements, HVAC systems, electrical layouts, and plumbing configurations, ensuring that all components fit together cohesively

- **Cost Estimation:** include features that automatically generate cost estimates based on the selected configurations, helping stakeholders budget more effectively

- **Compliance and Standards:** ensure that selected configurations meet relevant building codes and industry standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance.

- **Visualization:** They often provide 3D visualization tools to help stakeholders see the impact of their choices in real-time, facilitating better decision-making


## The processing issue with web configurators
When building a web configurator with Grasshopper, there is an issue with the data processing aspects. If you aim to use a practically infinite number of parameters, this solution would not be enough. An dyou will need a way to process the Grasshopper operations, in the background using RhinoCompute or  


## Our focus
For this module we will be looking into producing a static, pre-processed web configurator.

In other words, we will be building the all the possible panels configuration before hand.

We will be
